\chapter{Progress Statement}
	%We need to shorten this chapter
	We have continued along our current plan, working on each 
	section of the project simultaneously in sub-teams. A summary 
	of our progress is shown below:

	\begin{description}
		\item[Team Administration] \hfill \begin{itemize}
			\item A member of our team has dropped out due to personal
			reasons. In order to maintain our forward momentum, we
			have taken on an additional member.
			\item We have recieved three new sponsorships; two have 
			provided us with extra funding surrounding our project,
			the third company providing us with free custom PCB 
			manufacturing.
			\item Following our success with using Slack messenger for 
			internal communication and meeting scheduling,
			we are continuing with using this, further improving this
			by integrating our team's GitHub repositories with the relevant
			channels.
			\item Having sections of our team that have responsibilites for
			different	areas of the cansat development was leading to issues
			with team members not knowing how the overall	project was 
			progressing. The team leaders now collaborate to produce an
			internal report of progress every 2-3 weeks. This has recieved
			positive feedback within the team.
			\item We are continuing to utilise the sponsored licesnces we 
			recieved from TeamGantt to produce weekly gantt charts
			to ensure that we stay on schedule within each sub-team, in
			addition to an overall layout of our progress.
			\item We are continuing to maintain our website, hosted on the
			domain \url{gwccansat.com}, in addition to having officially launched our
			video blog (`vlog') programme, showing our progress on a weekly
			basis, leading up to the competition.
			\item The team has adopted new graphical designs for its logo and
			media/website backgrounds in order to give this year's campaign a fresh
			aesthetic.
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item[Mechanical development] \hfill \begin{itemize}
			\item We continue to work towards having a finalised 
			CAD model. This is dependent upon space requirements of
			our sensors and custom PCBs, so is still undergoing iterative
			revisions.
			\item Additionally, we are still working towards having a modular
			compartment for our secondary mission, allowing the cansat to
			be easily reused for other experiments with minimal physical
			changes made --- a simple case of plugging in and programming
			the new, relevant sensors.
		\end{itemize}

		\item[Electronics design] \hfill \begin{itemize}
			\item Our team hit some budgeting issues, leading us to
			consider other electronics options --- primarily in--house 
			assembly, as an alternative to PCB fabrication. This was recently
			resolved with the addition of our new sponsors, providing us
			with free PCB fabrication and more funding.
			\item We now have a definitive bill of materials (BOM) for 
			electronic components and materials that we will need.
			\item We also now have an initial schematic design, that is 
			ready to be made into a PCB design, provided that the software
			team have successfully interfaced and tested all the sensors and
			the mechanical team have provided ideal locations for the larger
			components on the PCB.
		\end{itemize}

		\item[Software design] \hfill \begin{itemize}
			\item Currently, the project progress is fullcruming off the
			dependency on testing the sensors from our current design.
			Hence, we have allocated extra team members and 
			resources to this section.
			\item We are currently working on testing each individual sensor, 
			to ensure that we are able to interface with them correctly with
			the current wiring solution and ready to make notes of any required 
			ammendments.
			\item Additionally, we are able to use elements of last year's code
			to assist us when creating the final cansat program and base
			station program.
		\end{itemize}

		\item[Secondary mission] \hfill \begin{itemize}
			\item We continue to strive towards having a diamagnetically 
			stabilised levitation exeriment to harvest vibration energy. We have
			unfortunately run into several technical problems, so are currently
			still working on having a functional experiment that produces power.
			\item As a precaution for the secondary mission not working, we 
			have begun brainstorming several other experiments to put in the
			secondary mission module. This is made easier by our modular
			experimental compartment in our cansat design.
			\item We have developed a plan to have multiple experiments ready
			by the time of the competition, so that we have a backup options
			in case of failure to prepare the main experiment. It will also allow
			us to demonstrate the concept of switching the experimental module 
			quickly.
		\end{itemize}

	\section{Mission Overview}
		\subsection{Mission Objectives}
		The team's objectives have remained largely the same, however, we have
		now put a larger emphasis on creating multiple experimental modules as part
		of our secondary mission. This is a precaution as explained further in the
		risk assessment.
		
		\subsubsection{Primary Mission}
		The primary mission commits the parameters for telemetry air pressure and
		air temperature. The chosen sensors also propose several other parameters, 
		which have been added as an extension of the primary mission: relative
		humidity, environmental gasses, acceleration, GPS position and cansat
		orientation.

		\subsubsection{Secondary Mission}
		The team has chosen to incorporate a small, modular, experimental
		compartment in the cansat. It will be used to house a small diamagnetically
		stabilised levitating ferromagnet, from which, energy from the vibrations in 
		the cansat may be harvested through use of a tuned inductor coil positioned
		close to the levitation experiment. The aim is to propose an alternative to
		traditional space and aircraft power acquisition methods such as solar arrays
		providing an advantage as it is able to be deployed from launch and allows
		otherwise wasted energy from other modules to be added back into the
		system. As a caveat, this method goes largely untested and therefore the
		primary purpose of the teamâ€™s experimentation is to test if this is a viable
		alternative to traditional power sources.\\
		

		{\color{blue} \textbf{Changes Made}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item More emphasis has been put on the secondary mission and its 
			ability to be switched out with an alternate experimental module.
			\item Other experiments are now being researched, such as detecting
			cosmic reactions happening in the atmsophere due to solar winds, etc.
		\end{itemize}

		{\color{blue} \textbf{Changes Made}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item 3D magnetic field strength is a redundant feature to measure
			and will not provide relevant data to the secondary mission. Therefore,
			it has been removed from the cansat design to streamline space, 
			performance, etc.
			\item Vibrations will be more accurately measured using the 
			accelerometer onboard the cansat, hence, the mechanical vibration
			sensor has been removed due to redundancy.
			\item The bridgetek CleO-CAM1 camera module from the former 
			report was overly complex for this application, in addition to being
			difficult to interface with. This has since been changed to the ArduCam
			OV5640, which utilises the same optical sensor, but is able to interface
			via I$^2$C (so is easily interfacable), has lower power consumption, and
			is more compact.\\\\

\chapter{Cansat Description}
	\section{Overview}
		This yearâ€™s entry has taken much more of an emphasis on a scientific
		experimental module as the secondary mission. Hence, we have designed 
		the cansat with a focus on technical and scientific accuracy. We aim to
		complete most of the cansat construction in-house. The only part of the
		cansat that we anticipate outsourcing is the PCB for the cansat, as we do
		not have access to the materials or machinery for creating our own.
		\\\\
		Care was taken to ensure that the electronic sensors used are not 
		negligibly affected by strong and changing magnetic fields, however 
		testing will be required later to confirm that this is not an issue before 
		any launches.
		\\\\
		{\color{blue}Although our cansat must be technically very accurate to ensure
		a successful secondary mission, the team also values the cansat's ability
		to be able to switch out experimental modules with ease, meaning that
		other experiments can be conducted within quick succession and minimal
		effort.}

	\section{Mechanical Design}

		\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.34\textwidth}
			\vspace{-47pt}
	 		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{placeholder}
			\end{center}
			\vspace{-15pt}
			\caption[X]{Prototype frame for experimental module compartment}
		\end{wrapfigure}

		The cansat is designed with a modular secondary mission compartment. 
		This will allow the cansat to be used with different experimental apparatus 
		in the future. A rail system will allow experimental apparatus to be set up,
		then slid into place and secured. Any electrical connections can be easily
		made with our modified pin-headers that lead to I2C terminals, GPIO and
		other commonly accessed pins. The experimental module proposed for 
		our entry is held together with a 3D printed frame and assembled by 
		hand, with an adjustable height magnet.
		\\\\
		The main cansat assembly is also secured with a lightweight 3D printed
		internal frame, which allows reliable mounting and placement of components
		and wiring. It is surrounded by a hand-made fiberglass shell, which will flex
		upon impact serving to absorb and disperse much of the shock of the
		cansat landing or any other collisions. Plastic plates are used on the top and
		bottom of the cansat for further protection of the cansat from shock. The 
		$\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ dipole communications antenna is mounted outside
		the outer shell along the long axis in order to optimise communications.

		\begin{figure}[H]
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{CadRenders}
			\end{center}
			\vspace{-15pt}
			\caption{Computer--aided design renders}
		\end{figure}

	\section{Electronics Design}
		Two independent cells are symmetrically distributed in the cansat and
		connected in series to deliver native 3.7V DC power to the cansat at 
		4800mAh power to the cansat sub-systems.
		Built-in IPS (Intelligent Power Select) in the CHIP Pro enables management
		of the power delivered to the other sub-systems in the cansat, providing
		flexible control over the battery life of the cansat. 
		\\\\
		The inductor coil from the secondary mission outputs an AC current, which
		is converted to a DC rms current via full-bridge rectifier and the output
		current and voltage read by the industry-standard ACS712 and a 
		high--resolution ADC respectively, since the CHIP Pro built-in ADC 
		does not offer a satisfactory resolution for the experimental precision.
		\\\\
		{\color{blue}For interfacing purposes, an arduino pro mini has been
		implemented to the electronics design. This will be used as a hard interface
		between the CHIP Pro and select sensors, in addition to possibly providing
		regulated power to some parts of the system. The arduino will not be 
		executing any complex calculations or data aggregation.}
		
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\begin{center}
				\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{placeholder}
			\end{center}
			\vspace{-15pt}
			\caption{Electronics sub-systems diagram}
		\end{figure}


	\section{Software Design}

		\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.33\textwidth}
			\vspace{-30pt}
	 		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{placeholder}
			\end{center}
			\vspace{-15pt}
			\caption[X]{Software system architecture diagram}
		\end{wrapfigure}

		The CHIP reads all incoming sensor data and applies lightweight processing
		to the values. All raw data is stored in built-in NAND storage on the CHIP
		or select raw data (larger sets such as camera footage) is stored in an
		onboard SD card for retrieval from ground crews. The processed data sets 
		are transmitted via 5 channels on a 433MHz frequency at up to 5,000bps
		baud rate. This allows for dedicated sensor channels in addition to a control
		channel, giving clean and organised telemetry of packets, as well as being
		able to pause telemetry of lower priority channels in cases of low 
		connection stability.
		\\\\
		The decision to use the CHIP Pro over a typical arduino or Raspberry Pi
		package was based on the 64--bit ARM--based processor running a 
		native Linux operating system, as well as built-in hardware to handle 
		wireless networking, bluetooth and battery regulation systems.
		\\\\
		{\color{blue}Previous iterations of the system architecture required 
		an Arduino Pro Mini in addition to the CHIP Pro for interfacing purposes.
		This year, the team aimed to omit this from the system requirements.
		Unfortunately, given the time and feasibility constraints, this must be deferred
		until later consideration.
		\\\\
		Additionally, the original plan to divide telemetry into
		5 channels may be less feasible than first envisaged. In which case, we will 
		take care to organise packets neatly on a lower number of bands.
		}

	\section{Landing and Recovery System}

		\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.33\textwidth}
			\vspace{-30pt}
	 		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.30\textwidth]{placeholder}
			\end{center}
			\vspace{-15pt}
			\caption[X]{Landing and recovery system diagram}
		\end{wrapfigure}

		We plan to use a basic drag parachute design to regulate the cansatâ€™s 
		descent speed. On landing, the fiberglass outer shell will flex, absorbing 
		some of the landing shock. Our cansat will have both a dedicated
		communications antenna and gps antenna. This means we will have 
		better connection to the base station and a high chance of accurate GPS lock.
		\\\\
		{\color{blue}As an additional measure, foam padding will be added 
		directly underneath the batteries to protect them from extensive damage, which
		could otherwise risk the battery life of the cansat during the recovery phase of
		the launch.}

	\section{Ground Support Equipment}
		The team is developing a lightweight, robust base station program, which 
		can be executed with very low system requirements. This has inspired a
		stretch goal to create an all-in-one base station by setting up the base 
		station software on a Raspberry PI package, as well as the communications
		module and I/O for SMA, display outputs, and USB ports.
		\\\\
		Our base station equipment will include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Custom made base-station computer with WiFi and bluetooth
			connectivity and >3 USB ports.
			\item HC-12 communications module and dedicated Yagi antenna
			\item Battery charging station and 5V supply
		\end{itemize}
		Our base station will receive, aggregate and display live data
		from all the onboard sensors, showing the relevant graphs to our primary
		and secondary missions, respectively. It will also store all raw and 
		processed data locally, in addition to backing up to an external drive or 
		laptop.

	\section{Team and External Support}
		We currently have five team members with varying levels of experience in
		mechanical, electronic, and software design. While our team has a good
		technical background in all aspects required for cansat design, {\color{blue}
		We have now completed a training programme to ensure the team is 
		prepared for the competition with the appropriate skills.}
		\\\\
		We also continue to arrange occasional meetings and communications with
		professionals in various relevant industries, thus improving our 
		understanding of how to further improve the quality of our electronics 
		and mechanical design decisions, as well as aiding us in preparing our
		secondary mission.

	\section{Physical Press}
		Following the success of our booth at the 2017 Edinburgh maker faire, we
		have signed up to attend as makers again this year. We are aiming to
		further improve our setup to engage interested parties (particularly children)
		in the 
		project to a greater extent than previously, including potential interactive

		We believe that in engaging kids with STEM at a young age, we will continue
		to inspire generations of scientists and engineers to come. We will also
		research into organising visits to other primary schools around the Edinburgh
		area.\\\\
		Following the largely successful 2017 campaign, the team featured in the
		 `Edinburgh Evening News' and aims to feature in other larger scale press
		releases such as this in future months.
